# Database Backup and Restore Procedures

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive backup and restore procedures for the AI-Driven Lead Capture & SMS Lead Nurturing Platform's MongoDB Atlas database infrastructure. The system implements a multi-layered backup strategy combining automated daily backups with manual backup capabilities to ensure data resilience and business continuity.

### Key Features
- MongoDB Atlas automated daily backups
- Manual backup procedures for on-demand snapshots
- Secure S3 storage integration with AES-256 encryption
- Point-in-time recovery capabilities
- Geographic redundancy across multiple regions
- Compliance-ready audit logging

## Backup Procedures

### MongoDB Atlas Automated Backups

MongoDB Atlas performs automated backups with the following configuration:

```yaml
Frequency: Daily
Retention Period: 7 days
Storage Location: AWS S3
Encryption: AES-256 at rest
```

#### Backup Schedule
- Full Backup: Daily at 02:00 UTC
- Incremental Updates: Every 6 hours
- Oplog Retention: 24 hours for point-in-time recovery

### Manual Backup Process

Execute manual backups using the provided backup script:

```bash
# Perform full database backup
./backup.sh -d database_name

# Backup specific collections
./backup.sh -d database_name -c collection1,collection2

# Force backup with override
./backup.sh -d database_name --force
```

### S3 Storage Configuration

Backups are automatically uploaded to S3 with the following structure:
```
s3://company-backups/
├── automated/
│   └── YYYY-MM-DD/
└── manual/
    └── YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM/
```

### Backup Verification

Each backup undergoes automatic verification:
1. Checksum validation
2. Sample data restoration test
3. Integrity check report generation

### Retention Policies

| Backup Type | Retention Period | Storage Location |
|-------------|------------------|------------------|
| Automated Daily | 7 days | Primary Region |
| Weekly Snapshots | 30 days | Cross-Region |
| Monthly Archives | 12 months | Cold Storage |
| Manual Backups | Until manually deleted | Primary Region |

## Restore Procedures

### Point-in-Time Recovery

To restore to a specific point in time:

```bash
./restore.sh -d database_name -t "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS"
```

### Full Database Restore

For complete database restoration:

```bash
./restore.sh -d database_name --full
```

### Selective Collection Restore

To restore specific collections:

```bash
./restore.sh -d database_name -c collection1,collection2
```

### Data Validation

Post-restore validation procedures:
1. Schema validation
2. Data integrity checks
3. Index verification
4. Application-level testing

## Monitoring and Alerts

### Backup Success Verification

Automated monitoring checks:
- Backup completion status
- Storage space utilization
- Encryption verification
- Cross-region replication status

### Alert Configuration

| Event | Severity | Notification Channel |
|-------|----------|---------------------|
| Backup Failure | Critical | Email, SMS |
| Storage > 80% | Warning | Email |
| Restore Initiated | Info | Email |
| Validation Error | High | Email, SMS |

## Security Considerations

### Encryption Standards

- At Rest: AES-256 encryption
- In Transit: TLS 1.3
- Key Management: AWS KMS

### Access Controls

| Role | Permissions |
|------|------------|
| Backup Admin | Full backup/restore access |
| Operator | View status, initiate restore |
| Auditor | View logs and reports |

### Audit Logging

All backup and restore operations are logged:
```json
{
  "operation": "backup|restore",
  "timestamp": "ISO-8601",
  "user": "operator_id",
  "status": "success|failure",
  "details": {}
}
```

## Disaster Recovery

### Recovery Time Objectives (RTO)

| Scenario | Target RTO |
|----------|------------|
| Single Collection | 1 hour |
| Full Database | 4 hours |
| Cross-Region | 8 hours |

### Recovery Point Objectives (RPO)

- Automated Backups: 24 hours
- Point-in-Time Recovery: 6 hours
- Transaction Logs: 1 hour

### Testing Schedule

| Test Type | Frequency | Scope |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Restore Validation | Weekly | Sample Data |
| Full Recovery | Monthly | Complete DB |
| DR Failover | Quarterly | Cross-Region |

## Performance Optimization

### Resource Utilization

- Backup Window: 02:00-06:00 UTC
- Compression Ratio: 2:1 target
- Network Bandwidth: 100 Mbps reserved

### Impact Assessment

Monitoring metrics during backup/restore:
- Database IOPS
- Network throughput
- Application response times
- Error rates

## Compliance Documentation

### Regulatory Requirements

- GDPR Article 32: Data backup requirements
- CCPA: Data protection measures
- SOC 2: Backup control objectives

### Audit Trail Maintenance

Retention of backup-related audit logs:
- Operation logs: 90 days
- Access logs: 12 months
- Compliance reports: 7 years

## Geographic Redundancy

### Cross-Region Configuration

Primary backup locations:
- US East (Primary)
- EU West (Secondary)
- AP Southeast (Tertiary)

### Failover Procedures

1. Automated health checks
2. Region availability verification
3. DNS failover configuration
4. Application reconnection handling

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Solution | Escalation |
|-------|----------|------------|
| Backup Failure | Retry with --force | Contact MongoDB Support |
| Restore Validation Error | Verify backup integrity | Engage DB Admin |
| Replication Lag | Check network connectivity | Infrastructure Team |
| Storage Full | Cleanup old backups | Storage Team |
