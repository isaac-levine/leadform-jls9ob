AI-Driven Lead Capture & SMS Lead Nurturing Platform

# WHY - Vision & Purpose

## 1. Purpose & Users

- Primary Problem Solved: Disconnected lead capture and SMS follow-up, lacking intelligent automation

- Target Users: Sales teams or real estate agents who need automated SMS nurturing with option for human oversight/intervention

- Value Proposition: Unified platform for form capture, AI-powered SMS automation, human takeover, and analytics on lead quality,

# WHAT - Core Requirements

## 2. Functional Requirements

### Core Features

System must:

- Enable creation and embedding of lead capture forms (like Typeform)

- Process form submissions and initiate SMS conversations (using AI agent)

- Power AI-driven initial SMS sequences (users should be able to choose or build specific sequences, but the AI should be able to respond at any point in time as well)

- Facilitate seamless human takeover of SMS threads (via admin portal/dashboard on the web app)

- Provide unified SMS inbox (user should be able to see all conversations via web portal/dashboard easily)

- Track conversation history and engagement (user should get stats/analytics on

- Support multiple SMS providers (architecture should be provider-agnostic)

- Handle SMS queuing and delivery status

The app must: be simple, not overengineered, we don't want to have to deploy things on AWS, we want this to be able to simply deploy to Vercel, we want the whole backend to be in Node.js and the whole frontend to be in Next.js

**For the frontend:**

- - - use Acetunity UI components and ShadCN

    - use twmerge and clsx

### User Capabilities

Users must be able to:

- Create and embed customizable forms

- View all SMS conversations in unified inbox

- Monitor AI-managed conversations

- Take over any conversation from AI instantly

- Set up automated SMS sequences

- View complete message history

- Configure AI behavior and templates

# HOW - Planning & Implementation

## 3. Technical Foundation

## 4. User Experience

### Primary User Flows

1. Lead Capture to SMS

   - Steps: Capture contact → AI initiates SMS → Await response

   - Success: Lead engagement via SMS

   - Alternative: Opt-out handling

2. Conversation Management

   - Entry: Unified inbox

   - Steps: View threads → Monitor AI → Take over

   - Success: Smooth AI-human transition

   - Alternative: Escalation path

3. Automation Setup

   - Entry: Automation settings

   - Steps: Create templates → Set rules → Test flow

   - Success: Working automation

   - Alternative: Manual override

### Core Interfaces

- SMS Inbox: All conversations in one view

- Thread View: Full history with takeover option

- Form Builder: Visual editor

- Analytics: Performance metrics

- Settings: System configuration

**Note:** Remember that we are prioritizing simplicity. I want to just be able to deploy this on Vercel and thats it. The only thing I want to have to deploy is the app (on Vercel) and then a database (MongoDB) ideally, but can also deploy a SQL database if needed.
