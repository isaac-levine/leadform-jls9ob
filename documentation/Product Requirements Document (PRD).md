# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

# 1. INTRODUCTION

## 1.1 Purpose

This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document provides a comprehensive description of the AI-Driven Lead Capture & SMS Lead Nurturing Platform. It details the functional and non-functional requirements for developers, project managers, and stakeholders involved in the development process. The document serves as the primary reference for technical implementation and validation of the delivered system.

## 1.2 Scope

The AI-Driven Lead Capture & SMS Lead Nurturing Platform is a unified solution that automates and streamlines the lead capture and follow-up process through intelligent SMS communication. The system encompasses:

- Lead capture form creation and embedding capabilities
- AI-powered SMS conversation management
- Human-AI collaborative messaging interface
- Analytics and engagement tracking
- Provider-agnostic SMS integration

Key benefits include:

- Reduced manual intervention in lead nurturing
- Consistent and timely follow-up communication
- Seamless transition between AI and human agents
- Centralized lead management
- Scalable messaging architecture

The platform will be built using:

- Next.js for frontend development
- Node.js for backend services
- Vercel for deployment
- MongoDB for data storage
- Acetunity UI and ShadCN for component library
- SMS provider integration layer

Out of scope:

- Custom SMS provider implementations
- Multi-channel communication (focus on SMS only)
- Complex deployment architectures beyond Vercel
- Custom AI model training

IMPORTANT NOTE: This is an MVP, I want the build and deploy process to be simple!! Very simple! I want to just set up a database using some db provider, and then upload this repo to Vercel, and bang it is live.
